# Rocketloop - Machine Learning Classification Demos

The dataset in `data_files` is from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult.

We included reduced data sets in the data_files folder to compare training times. The files were created using the datasplitter.py, a small script which splits a dataset into a 1/4 train set and 3/4 test set. It may be a bit buggy so verify the outcome manually if you want to use it. Usage: Change the value for 'file' to the file you want to split. Change the value for 'filee' to the file you want to store the train data in. Change the value for 'fileee' to the file you want to store the test data in.   

To use the classifiers.py just change the values of the files in the main function.
